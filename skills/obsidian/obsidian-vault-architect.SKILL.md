# obsidian-vault-architect

## Purpose

Establishes and maintains the structural backbone of an Obsidian vault. Defines folder hierarchy, naming conventions, MOC (Map of Content) placement, template files, and tag taxonomy. Ensures consistent vault architecture across all domain-specific skills that write to Obsidian.

## Invocation

**OpenCode / Codex:** `Invoke obsidian-vault-architect`
**Freebuff:** `/skill obsidian-vault-architect`

## Workflow Steps

1. **Audit:** Survey current vault structure and identify inconsistencies.
2. **Design:** Propose folder hierarchy (Inbox, Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive - PARA or custom).
3. **Templates:** Create note templates for each domain (music, homelab, daily log).
4. **Tag taxonomy:** Define canonical tag set and document in `META/tags.md`.
5. **MOC:** Create or update index MOC notes for each top-level domain.
6. **Enforce:** Apply naming conventions to existing notes via rename batch.

## Safety

- Never delete notes; only rename or move with user confirmation.
- Always backup vault before structural changes.
- Log all changes to a vault-change-log note.
