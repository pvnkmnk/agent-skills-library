# subsonic-media-server

## Purpose
Provide agent-level control over a self-hosted Subsonic-compatible music streaming server (Navidrome recommended). Enables playlist management, library rescan triggers, now-playing queries, and playback control via the OpenSubsonic REST API.

## Invocation
- "What's playing on Navidrome?"
- "Create a playlist called [name] with [tracks]"
- "Trigger Navidrome library rescan"
- "Search Navidrome for [artist/album/track]"
- "Get recently added albums from Subsonic"
- "Stream [song] via Subsonic"

## Workflow Steps
1. **Authenticate:** Use Subsonic API token auth (`u=`, `t=`, `s=`, `v=`, `c=` params) against configured server URL.
2. **Query:** Call appropriate OpenSubsonic REST endpoint (e.g., `/rest/getArtists`, `/rest/search3`, `/rest/getNowPlaying`).
3. **Parse:** Extract relevant data from XML/JSON response.
4. **Act:** Perform requested action — create/update playlist, return results, trigger scan, etc.
5. **Rescan:** After `music-library-organizer` runs, call `/rest/startScan` to index new files.
6. **Log:** Record significant events (new content indexed, playlist changes) in `homelab-logbook`.

## Safety
- Never expose Subsonic API credentials in logs or responses.
- Do not delete playlists or user data without explicit confirmation.
- Validate server reachability before attempting bulk operations.

## MCP
- **subsonic-mcp** (`mcp/subsonic-mcp.json`) — OpenSubsonic REST wrapper; provides search, playlist, scan, stream tools.

## Companion Skills
- `music-library-organizer` — feeds organized files into the server library
- `slskd-media-acquisition` — upstream acquisition source
- `dj-library-curator` — curates playlists served here
- `media-stack-builder` — deploys and configures this server
- `homelab-logbook` — logs scan and playback events
